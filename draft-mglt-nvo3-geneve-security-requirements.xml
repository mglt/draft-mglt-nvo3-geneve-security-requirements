<t>The network virtualization overlay over Layer 3 (NVO3)  as depicted in
Figure 1, allows an overlay cloud provider to provide a logical L2/L3
interconnect for the Tenant Systems TSes that belong to a specific
tenant network. A packet received from a TS is encapsulated by the
ingress Network Virtualization Edge (NVE). The encapsulated packet is
then sent to the remote NVE through a tunnel. When reaching the egress
NVE of the tunnel, the packet is decapsulated and forwarded to the
target TS. The L2/L3 address mappings to the remote NVE(s) are
distributed to the NVEs by a logically centralized Network
Virtualization Authority (NVA) or using a distributed control plane such
as Ethernet-VPN. In a datacenter, the NVO3 tunnels can be implemented
using Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve)
<xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve"/>. Such Geneve tunnels establish NVE-to-NVE
communications, may transit within the data center via Transit device.
The Geneve tunnels overlay network enable multiple Virtual Networks to
coexist over a shared underlay infrastructure, and a Virtual Network may
span a single data center or multiple data centers.</t>

<t>The underlay infrastructure on which the multi-tenancy overlay networks
are hosted, can be owned and provided by an underlay provider who may be
different from the overlay cloud provider.</t>

<t>This document discusses the security risks that a Geneve based NVO3
network may encounter. In addition, this document lists the requirements
to protect the Geneve packet components defined in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve"/> that include the Geneve tunnel IP and UDP
header, the Geneve Header, Geneve options, and inner payload.</t>

<t>The document provides two sets of security requirements:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>SEC-OP: requirements to evaluate a given deployment of Geneve
overlay. Such requirements are intended to Geneve overlay provider to
evaluate a given deployment. Security of the Geneve packet may be
achieved using various mechanisms.  Typically, some deployments may use
a limited subset of the capabilities provided by Geneve and rely on
specific assumptions. Given these specificities, the secure deployment
of a given Geneve deployment may be achieved reusing specific mechanisms
such as for example DTLS or IPsec. On the other hand, the definition of
a security mechanisms that enables to secure any Geneve deployment
requires the design of a Geneve specific mechanism. Note that the
security s limited to the security of the data plane only. Additional
requirements for the control plan MAY be considered in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements"/>.</t>
  <t>SEC-GEN: requirements a security mechanism need to fulfill to secure
any deployment of Geneve overlay deployment. Such mechanism may require
the design of a specific solution. In the case new protocol needs to be
design, the document strongly recommend to re-use existing security
protocols like IP Security (IPsec) <xref target="RFC4301"/> and Transport Layer
Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC5246"/>, and existing encryption algorithms ( such
as <xref target="RFC8221"/>),  and authentication protocols.</t>
</list></t>

<t>This document assumes the following roles are involved:
- Tenant: designates the entity that connects various systems within a
single virtualized network. The various system can typically be
containers, VMs implementing a single or various functions.<vspace />
- Geneve Overlay Provider: provides the Geneve overlay that seamlessly
connect the various Tenant Systems over a given virtualized network. <vspace />
- Infrastructure Provider: provides the infrastructure that runs the
Geneve overlay network as well as the Tenant System. A given deployment
may consider different infrastructure provider with different level of
trust. Typically the Geneve overlay network may use a public cloud to
extend the resource of a private cloud. Similarly, a edge computing may
extend its resources using resource of the core network.</t>

<t>Tenant, Geneve Overlay Provider and Infrastructure Provider can be
implemented by a single or various different entities with different
level of trust between each other. The simplest deployment may consists
in a single entity running its systems in its data center and using
Geneve in order to manage its internal resources. A more complex use
case may consider that a Tenant subscribe to the Geneve Overlay Provider
which manage the virtualized network over various type of
infrastructure. The trust between the Tenant, Geneve Overlay Provider
and Infrastructure Provider may be limited.</t>

<t>Given the different relations between Tenant, Geneve Overlay Provider
and Infrastructure Provider, this document aims providing requirements
to ensure:
1. The Geneve Overlay Provider delivers tenant payload traffic (Geneve
inner payload) and ensuring privacy and integrity. 
2. The Geneve Overlay Provider provides the necessary means to prevent
injection or redirection of the Tenant traffic from a rogue node in the
Geneve overlay network or a rogue node from the infrastructure. 
3. The Geneve Overlay Provider can rely on the Geneve overlay in term of
robustness and reliability of the signaling associated to the Geneve
packets (Geneve tunnel header, Geneve header and Geneve options) in
order to appropriately manage its overlay.</t>

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">

<t>This document uses the terminology of <xref target="RFC8014"/>, <xref target="RFC7365"/> and
<xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-threats" title="Security Threats">

<t>Attacks from compromised NVO3 and underlay network devices, and attacks
from compromised tenant systems defined in
<xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements"/>. This document considers these
attacks in the scope of Geneve, that is when the attackers knowing the
details of the Geneve packets can perform their attacks by changing
fields in the Geneve tunnel header, base header, Geneve options and
Geneve inner payload. The scope of Geneve excludes security requirements
related to the control plane.</t>

<t>Threats include traffic analysis, sniffing, injection, redirection, and
replay. Based on these threats, this document enumerates the security
requirements.</t>

<t>Threats are divided into two categories:  passive attack and active
attack.</t>

<t>Threats are always associated with risks and the evaluation of these
risks depend among other things on the environment.</t>

<section anchor="passive-attacks" title="Passive Attacks">

<t>Passive attacks include traffic analysis (noticing which workloads
are communicating with which other workloads, how much traffic, and when
those communications occur) and sniffing (examining traffic for useful
information such as personally-identifyable information or protocol
information (e.g., TLS certificate, overlay routing protocols).</t>

<t>A rogue element of the overlay Geneve network under the control of an
attacker may leak and redirect the traffic from a virtual network to the
attacker for passive monitoring <xref target="RFC7258"/>.</t>

<t>Avoiding leaking information is hard to enforced and the security
requirements expect to mitigate such attacks by lowering the
consequences, typically making leaked data unusable to an attacker..</t>

</section>
<section anchor="active-attacks" title="Active Attacks">

<t>Active attacks involve modifying packets, injecting packets, or
interfering with packet delivery (such as by corrupting packet
checksum). Active attack may target the Tenant System or the Geneve
overlay.</t>

<t>There are multiple motivations to inject illegitimate traffic into a
tenants network. When the rogue element is on the path of the TS
traffic, it may be able to inject and receive the corresponding messages
back. On the other hand, if the attacker is not on the path of the TS
traffic it may be limited to only inject traffic to a TS without
receiving any response back. When rogue element have access to the
traffic in both directions, the possibilities are only limited by the
capabilities of the other on path elements - Transit device, NVE or TS -
to detect and protect against the illegitimate traffic. On the other
hand, when the rogue element is not on path, the surface for such
attacks remains still quite large. For example, an attacker may target a
specific TS or application by crafting a specific packet that can either
generate load on the system or crash the system or application. TCP syn
flood typically overload the TS while not requiring the ability to
receive responses. Note that udp application are privileged target as
they do not require the establishment of a session and are expected to
treat any incoming packets.</t>

<t>Traffic injection may also be used to flood the virtual network to
disrupt the communications between the TS or to introduce additional
cost for the tenant, for example when pricing considers the traffic
inside the virtual network. The two latest attacks may also take
advantage of applications with a large factor of amplification for their
responses as well as applications that upon receiving a packet interact
with multiple TS. Similarly, applications running on top of UDP are
privileged targets.</t>

<t>Note also that an attacker that is not able to receive the response
traffic, may use other channels to evaluate or measure the impact of the
attack. Typically, in the case of a service, the attacker may have
access, for example, to a user interface that provides indication on the
level of disruption and the success of an attack, Such feed backs may
also be used by the attacker to discover or scan the network.</t>

<t>Preventing traffic to cross virtual networks, reduce the surface of
attack, but rogue element main still perform attacks within a
given virtual network by replaying a legitimate packet. Some variant of
such attack also includes modification of unprotected parts when
available in order for example to increase the payload size.</t>

</section>
</section>
<section anchor="requirements-for-security-mitigations" title="Requirements for Security Mitigations">

<t>The document assumes that Security protocols, algorithms, and
implementations provide the security properties for which they are
designed, an attack caused by a weakness in a cryptographic algorithm is
out of scope.</t>

<t>Protecting network connecting TSes and NVEs which could be accessible
to outside attackers is out of scope.</t>

<t>An attacker controlling an underlying network device may break the
communication of the overlays by discarding or delaying the delivery of
the packets passing through it. The security consideration to prevent
this type of attack is out of scope of this document.</t>

<t>Securing communication between NVAs and NVEs is out of scope.</t>

<t>Selectively providing integrity / authentication, confidentiality /
encryption of only portions of the Geneve packet is in scope. This will
be the case if the Tenant Systems uses security protocol to protect its
communications.</t>

<section anchor="sniffing" title="Protection Against Traffic Sniffing">

<t>Passive attacks consists in inferring information about a virtualized
network or some Tenant System from observing the traffic. This could
also involve the correlation between observed traffic and additional
information.  For example, a passive network observer can determine two
virtual machines are communicating by manipulating activity or network
activity of other virtual machines on that same host. For example, the
attacker could control (or be otherwise aware of) network activity of
the other VMs running on the same host, and deduce other network
activity is due to a victim VM.</t>

<t>The inner payload, unless protection is provided by the Tenant System
reveals the content of the communication. This may mitigate by the
Tenant using application level security such as, for example JSON Web
Encryption <xref target="RFC7516"/> or transport layer security such as DTLS or TLS
or IPsec/ESP. However none of these security protocols are sufficient to
protect the entire inner payload. IPsec/ESP still leave in clear the
optional L2 layer information as well as the IP addresses and some IP
options. In addition to these pieces of information, the use of TLS or
DTLS reveals the transport layer protocol as well as ports.</t>

<t>A secure deployment of a Geneve overlay must fulfill the requirement
below:</t>

<t><list style="numbers">
  <t>SEC-OP-1: A secure deployment of a Geneve overlay SHOULD by default
encrypt the inner payload. A Geneve overlay provider MAY disable this
capability for example when encryption is performed by the Tenant System
and that level of confidentiality is believed to be sufficient. In order
to provide additional protection to traffic already encrypted by the
Tenant the Geneve network operator MAY partially encrypt the clear part
of the inner payload.</t>
</list></t>

<t>A Geneve security mechanism must fulfill the requirements
below:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>SEC-GEN-1: Geneve security mechanism MUST provide the capability to
encrypt the inner payload.</t>
  <t>SEC-GEN-2: Geneve security mechanism SHOULD provide the capability to
partially encrypt the inner payload header.</t>
</list></t>

<t>The Geneve Header and Geneve Options contains metadata information
related to the communications. Note that a Geneve packet may have a
combination of Geneve options that needs to be read by transit device,
in which case this option needs to be read by the transit device while
other options MAY only be accessed by the terminating NVE. Information
revealed as well as correlation with traffic volumetry may reveal
pattern traffic within a given virtualized network as well as any
information revealed by the current and future Geneve Option.</t>

<t>A secure deployment of a Geneve overlay must fulfill the requirement
below:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>SEC-OP-2: A secure deployment of a Geneve overlay MUST evaluate the
information associated to the leakage of the Geneve Outer Header, Geneve
Header and Geneve Option. When those information are likely to carry
sensitive information. they MUST NOT be transmit in clear text.</t>
  <t>SEC-OP-3: A secure deployment of a Geneve overlay MUST evaluate the
risk associated to traffic pattern recognition. When a risk has been
identified, traffic pattern recognition MUST be addressed with padding
policies as well as generation of dummy packets.</t>
</list></t>

<t>A Geneve security mechanism must fulfill the requirements
below:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>SEC-GEN-3: Geneve security mechanism MUST provide the capability to
encrypt a single or a set of options while leave other Geneve Option in
clear. Reversely, a Geneve security mechanism MUST be able to leave a
Geneve option in clear, while encrypting the others.</t>
  <t>SEC-GEN-4: Geneve security mechanism MUST provide means to encrypt
the information of Geneve Header. Reversely, a Geneve security mechanism
MUST be able to leave in clear header information while encrypting the
other.</t>
  <t>SEC-GEN-5: Geneve security mechanism MUST provide the ability to pad
a Geneve packet.</t>
  <t>SEC-GEN-6: Geneve security mechanism MUST provide the ability to send
dummy packets.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="injection" title="Protecting Against Traffic Injection">

<t>Traffic injection from a rogue non legitimate NVO3 Geneve overlay device
or a rogue underlay transit device can target an NVE, a transit underlay
device or a Tenant System. Targeting a Tenant's System requires a valid
MAC and IP addresses of the Tenant's System.</t>

<t>Tenant's System may protect their communications using IPsec or TLS.
Such protection protects the Tenants from receiving spoofed packets, as
any injected packet is expected to be discarded by the destination
Tenant's System.  Such protection does not protect the tenant system
from receiving illegitimate packets that may disrupt the Tenant's System
performance. The Geneve overlay network MAY still need to prevent such
spoofed Tenant's system packets from being steered to the Tenant's
system. When the Tenant's Systems are not protecting their
communications, the Geneve overlay network SHOULD be able to to prevent
a rogue device from injecting traffic into the overlay network.</t>

<t>In order to prevent traffic injection to one virtual network, the
destination legitimate Geneve NVE MUST be able to authenticate the
incoming Geneve packets from the source NVE.  The Geneve architecture
considers transit devices that MAY process some Geneve Option without
affecting the Geneve packet. These transit device MAY Authenticate the
Geneve packet as part of the Geneve packet processing but MAY also
process other Geneve options. As a result, integrity protection and
authentication SHOULD be performed by transit device, prior to any
processing.</t>

<t>A secure deployment of a Geneve overlay must fulfill the requirement
below:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>SEC-OP-4: A secure deployment of a Geneve overlay SHOULD
authenticate communications between NVE to protect the Geneve Overlay
infrastructure as well as the Tenants System's communications (Geneve
Packet). A Geneve overlay provider MAY disable authentication of the
inner packet and delegates it to the Tenant Systems when communications
between Tenant's System is secured. This is NOT RECOMMENDED. To prevent
injection between virtualized network, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that
at least the Geneve Header is authenticated.</t>
  <t>SEC-OP-5: A secure deployment of a Geneve overlay SHOULD NOT process
data prior authentication. If that is not possible, the Geneve overlay
provider SHOULD evaluate its impact.</t>
</list></t>

<t>A Geneve security mechanism must fulfill the requirements
below:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>SEC-GEN-8: Geneve Security mechanism MUST provide means for a
terminating node (NVE) to  authenticate data prior it is being
processed. A terminating node (NVE) MUST be able to authenticate at
least:
  <list style="symbols">
      <t>the Geneve Header and a subset of Geneve Options</t>
      <t>the Geneve Header, a subset of Geneve options and the Geneve
inner payload</t>
      <t>the Geneve Header, a subset of Geneve options and the Geneve
inner payload or the portion of the inner payload in case the Tenant's
System provides some authentication mechanism.</t>
    </list></t>
  <t>SEC-GEN-9: Geneve Security mechanism SHOULD provide means for a
transit device to authenticate the Geneve Option prior processing it.
Authentication MAY concern the whole Geneve packet, but MAY be limited
to the Geneve Option.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="protecting-against-traffic-redirection" title="Protecting Against Traffic Redirection">

<t>A rogue device of the NVO3 overlay Geneve network or the underlay
network may redirect the traffic from a virtual network to the attacker
for passive or active attacks. If the rogue device is in charge of the
securing the Geneve packet, then Geneve security mechanisms are not
intended to address this threat. More specifically, a rogue source NVE
will still be able to redirect the traffic in clear text before
protecting ( and encrypting the packet). A rogue destination NVE will
still be able to redirect the traffic in clear text after decrypting the
Geneve packets. The same occurs with a rogue transit that is in charge
of encrypting and decrypting a Geneve Option,  Geneve Option or any
information. The security mechanisms are intended to protect a Geneve
information from any on path  node. Note that modern cryptography
recommend the use of authenticated encryption. This section assumes such
algorithms are used, and as such encrypted packets are also
authenticated.</t>

<t>To prevent an attacker located in the middle between the NVEs and
modifying the tunnel address information in the data packet header to
redirect the data traffic, the solution need to provide confidentiality
protection for data traffics exchanged between NVEs.</t>

<t>Requirements are similar as those provided in section <xref target="sniffing"/> to
mitigate sniffing attacks and those provided in section <xref target="injection"/>
to mitigate traffic injection attacks.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="protecting-against-traffic-replay" title="Protecting Against Traffic Replay">

<t>A rogue device of the NVO3 overlay Geneve network or the underlay
network may replay a Geneve packet, to load the network and/or a
specific Tenant System with a modified Geneve payload. In some cases,
such attacks may target an increase of the tenants costs.</t>

<t>When traffic between tenants is not protected, the rogue device may
forward the modified packet over a valid (authenticated) Geneve Header.
The crafted packet may for example, include a specifically crafted
application payload for a specific Tenant Systems application, with the
intention to load the tenant specific application.</t>

<t>Updating the Geneve header and option parameters such as setting an
OAM bit, adding bogus option TLVs, or setting a critical bit, may result
in different processing behavior, that could greatly impact performance
of the overlay network and the underlay infrastructure and thus affect
the tenants traffic delivery.</t>

<t>The NVO3 overlay network and underlay network nodes that may address
such attacks MUST provide means to authenticate the Geneve packet
components.</t>

<t>A secure deployment of a Geneve overlay must fulfill the requirement
below:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>SEC-OP-6: A secure deployment of a Geneve overlay MUST evaluate the
flows subject to replay attacks. Flows that are subject to this attacks
MUST be authenticated with an anti replay mechanism. Note that when
partial authentication is provided, the part not covered by the
authentication remains a surface of attack. It is strongly RECOMMENDED
that the Geneve Header is both authenticated with anti replay
protection.</t>
</list></t>

<t>A Geneve security mechanism must fulfill the requirements
below:</t>

security policies for different flows. A flow MUST be identified at
minimum by the Geneve virtual network identifier and the inner IP and
transport headers, and optionally additional fields which define a flow
(e.g., inner IP DSCP, IPv6 flow id, Geneve options).</t>
  <t>SEC-GEN-12: A Geneve security mechanism MUST be able to assign
different cryptographic keys to protect the unicast tunnels between NVEs
respectively.</t>
  <t>SEC-GEN-13: A Geneve security mechanisms, when multicast is used,
packets,MUST be able to assign distinct cryptographic group keys to
protect the multicast packets exchanged among the NVEs within different
multicast groups. Upon receiving a data packet, an egress Geneve NVE
MUST be able to verify whether the packet is sent from a proper ingress
NVE which is authorized to forward that packet.</t>

<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>The whole document is about security.</t>

<t>Limiting the coverage of the authentication / encryption provides
some means for an attack to craft special packets.</t>

<t>The current document details security requirements that are related to
the Geneve protocol. Instead, <xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements"/>
provides generic architecture security requirement upon the deployment
of an NVO3 overlay network. It is strongly recommended to read that
document as architecture requirements also apply here. In addition,
architecture security requirements go beyond the scope of Geneve
communications, and as such are more likely to address the security
needs upon deploying an Geneve overlay network.</t>

<section anchor="tls" title="TLS">

<t>This section compares how NVE communications using TLS meet the security
requirements for a secure Geneve overlay deployment. In this example TLS
is used over the Geneve Outer Header and secured the Geneve Header,
Geneve Options and the inner payload.</t>

<t>The use of TLS MAY fill the security requirements for a secure Geneve
deployment. However TLS cannot be considered as the Geneve security
mechanism enabling all Geneve deployments.</t>

<t>The use of to secure a Geneve overlay deployment TLS meets SEC-OP-1 as
it protects the inner payload of the tenant. It meets SEC-OP-2 as except
from the UDP port, no information concerning Geneve is leaked. SEC-OP-3
is not met as TLS does not provide the ability to send dummy traffic,
nor to pad. SEC-OP-4 is met as the communication is authenticated,
including the Geneve Header.  SEC-OP-5 is met as the Geneve Packet is
processed once it has been authenticated.  SEC-OP-6 is met as TLS comes
with anti replay protection.  SEC-OP-7 and SEC-OP-8 may also be met with
security policies established per UDP destination port where only
unicast is considered.</t>

<t>The use of TLS as a generic Geneve Security mechanism meets SEC-GEN-1 as
it encrypts the inner payload. However, TLS, but does not enable partial
encryption of the inner payload. TLS does not meet SEC-GEN3 or SEC-GEN-4
that requires the ability to encrypt of a subset of the Geneve Options
or the Geneve Header information. In addition, TLS does not enable that
some Geneve option of Header information remain in clear text while
other are encrypted. Typically TLS would not be compatible with transit
nodes. In addition is make the Geneve option visible to the transit
node, TLS does not provide the ability for a transit node to
authenticate the option before processing it. SEC-GEN-5 and SEC-GEN-6
are not met as TLS does not provide padding nor the ability to generate
dummy packets. TLS does not meet SEC-GEN-8 that requires the ability to
authenticate some combination of Geneve Header, Geneve Options,
(partial) inner payload.  TLS does not meet SEC-GEN-9 that requires the
ability to authenticate a single Geneve Option. TLS meets SEC-GEN-10 as
it provides anti replay mechanism to the authentication. SEC-GEN-11 is
not natively supported as TLS security is established by UDP destination
ports, rather than by flow.  If more than one security policy or flow
needs to be considered a binding between flow and ports needs to be
established.   SEC-GEN-13 is not met for mutlicast traffic.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="ipsec" title="IPsec">

<t>The use of IPsec/ESP or IPsec/AH share most of the analysis performed
for TLS. The main advantages of using IPsec would be that IPsec supports
multicast communications and natively supports flow based security
policies. However, the use of these security policies in a context of
Geneve is not natively supported.</t>
