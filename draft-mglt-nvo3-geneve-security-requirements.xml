    <section title="Introduction">

<t>The network virtualization overlay over Layer 3 (NVO3)  as depicted
in <xref target="arch"/>, allows an overlay cloud provider to provide a
logical L2/L3 interconnect for the Tenant Systems TSes that belong to a
specific tenant network. A packet received from a tenant system is
encapsulated by the ingress Network Virtualization Edge (NVE). The
encapsulated packet is then sent to the remote NVE through a proper
tunnel. When reaching the egress NVE of the tunnel, the packet is
decapsulated and forwarded to the target tenant system. The L2/L3
address mappings to the remote NVE(s) are distributed to the NVEs by a
logically centralized Network Virtualization Authority (NVA) or using a
distributed control plane such as Ethernet-VPN.  In a datacenter, the
NVO3 tunnels can be implemented using Generic Network Virtualization
Encapsulation (Geneve) <xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve"/>.  The
Geneve tunnels overlay network enable multiple Virtual Networks to
coexist over a shared underlay infrastructure, and a Virtual Network may
span a single data center or multiple data centers.</t>  

<t>The underlay infrastructure on which the multi-tenancy overlay
networks are hosted, can be owned and provided by an underlay provider
who may be different from the overlay cloud provider.</t>

<t>This document discusses the security risks that a Geneve based NVO3
network may encounter and tries to provide a list of essential security
requirements that needs to be fulfilled. In addition, this document
lists the requirements to protect the Geneve packet components defined
in <xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve"/> that include the Geneve tunnel IP and UDP
header, the Geneve Header, Geneve options, and inner payload. Protecting
the complete Geneve packet is out of scope of this document, given that
this can be supported using existing mechanisms.</t> 

<t>This document assumes that a tenant subscribes to an overlay cloud
provider for hosting its Tenant Systems, the cloud provider manages the
Geneve overlay network on behalf of the tenant.  The overlay network
will be hosted on an underlay network infrastructure, that may be
managed by another underlay network provider.</t>

<t>The security requirements in this document aims at providing the overlay
cloud provider the necessary options to ensure:

<list style="numbers">

<t>Delivering tenant payload traffic and ensuring privacy, integrity
and isolation over the overlay and underlay networks, as well preventing
tenant traffic from being redirected or injected to other tenants.</t>

<t>Protecting tenant traffic from rogue devices in the providers of
Geneve overlay or underlay networks.</t>

</list></t>

<t>In summary, the document defines the security requirements to protect
tenants overlay traffic against security threats from the NVO3 network
components that are interconnected with tunnels implemented using
Geneve. As well, the document strongly recommend to re-use existing
security protocols like IP Security (IPSec) <xref target="RFC4301"/> and
Transport Layer Security (TLS) <xref target="RFC5246"/>, and existing
encryption algorithms,  and authentication protocols.</t>


<t>Authentication requirements for NVO3 devices, automated key
management, as well as packet level security providing confidentiality,
integrity and authorization requirements defined in <xref
target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements"/> are also requirements for
this document.</t>

</section>

<section title="Terminology">

<t>This document uses the terminology of <xref target="RFC8014"/>, <xref
target="RFC7365"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve"/></t>

</section>

<section title="Security Threats">

<t>Attacks from compromised NVO3 and underlay network devices, and
attacks from compromised tenant systems defined in <xref
target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-security-requirements"/> are considered for the
Geneve overlay network. Furthermore, the attackers knowing the details
of the Geneve packets can perform their attacks by changing fields in
the Geneve tunnel header, base header, Geneve options and Geneve packet
inner payload. </t>

<t>Typical threats include traffic injection, traffic redirection,
traffic replay. Based on these threats, this document derive the
security requirements.</t>

<t>There are multiple motivations to inject illegitimate traffic in to a
tenants network. When the rogue node is the path of the TS traffic, the
rogue node may be able to inject and receive the corresponding messages
back. On the other hand, if the attacker is not on the path of the TS
traffic it may be limited to only inject traffic to a TS without
receiving any response back. When rogue nodes has access to the traffic
in both directions, the possibilities are limited only limited by the
capabilities of the other on path elements - NVO3 elements, NVE or TS -
to detect and protect against the illegitimate traffic. When the rogue
node is not on path, it is expected that it is unlikely to receives
responses back. Even though this limits the scope of attacks, the
surface for such attacks remains large. For example, an attacker may
target a specific TS or application by crafting a specific packet that
can either generates load on the system or crash the system or
application. TCP syn flood attack typically overload the TS. Note that
udp application are privileged target as they do not require the
establishment of a session and are expected to treat any incoming
packets. </t>

<t>Traffic injection may also be used to flood the virtual network to
disrupt the communications between the TS or to introduce additional
cost for the tenant, for example when pricing considers the traffic
inside the virtual network.  The two latest attacks may also take
advantage of applications with a large factor of amplification for their
responses as well as applications that upon receiving a packet interact
with multiple TS.  Similarly, applications running on top of UDP are
privileged targets.</t>

<t>Note also that even if the attacker may not be able to receive the
response traffic, the attacker may use other channels to evaluate or
measure the impact of the attack. Typically, in the case of a service,
the attacker may have access, for example, to a user interface that
provides indication on the level of disruption and the success of an
attack, Such feed backs may also be used by the attacker to discover or
scan the network.</t>

<t>A rogue element of the overlay Geneve network under the control of an
attacker may leak and redirect the traffic from a virtual network to the
attacker for passive monitoring <xref target="RFC7258"/>, or for
actively re-injecting a modified Geneve packet into the overlay.</t>

<t>Avoiding leaking information is hard to enforced and the security
requirements expect to mitigate such attacks by lowering the
consequences, typically making leaked data unusable to an
attacker..</t>

<t>Preventing traffic to cross virtual networks, reduce the surface of
attack. but  rogue NVO3 element main still perform attacks within a
given virtual network by replaying a legitimate packet. Some variant of
such attack also includes modification of unprotected parts when
available in order for example to increase the payload size.</t>

<t>In the next section we will provide security mitigations
against such attacks.</t>

</section>

<section title="Requirements for Security mitigations">

<t>The document assumes that Security protocols, algorithms, and
implementations provide the security properties for which they are
designed, an attack caused by a weakness in a cryptographic algorithm is
out of scope.</t>

<t>Protecting network connecting TSes and NVEs which could be accessible
to outside attackers is out of scope.</t>

<t>An attacker controlling an underlying network device may break the
communication of the overlays by discarding or delaying the delivery of
the packets passing through it. The security consideration to prevent
this type of attack is out of scope of this document.</t>

<t>Securing communication between NVAs and NVEs is out of scope.</t>

<t>Selectively providing integrity/authentication,
confidentiality/encryption of only portions of the Geneve packet is in
scope. This will be the case if the Tenant Systems uses security
protocol to protect its communications.</t>

<section title="Protecting against traffic injection">

<t>Traffic injection from a rogue non legitimate NVO3 Geneve overlay
device or a rogue underlay transit device can target an NVE, a transit
underlay device or a Tenant System.  Targeting a Tenant's System
requires a valid MAC and IP addresses of the Tenant's System.</t>

<t>Tenant's System may protect their communications using IPsec or TLS.
Such protection protects the Tenants from receiving spoofed packets, as
any injected packet is expected to be discarded by the destination
Tenant's System.  Such protection does not protect the tenant system
from receiving illegitimate packets that may disrupt the Tenant's System
performance.</t>

<t>The Geneve overlay network MAY still need to prevent such spoofed
Tenant's system packets from being steered to the Tenant's system.</t>

<t>When the Tenant's System are not protecting their communications, the
Geneve overlay network SHOULD be able to to prevent a rogue device from
injecting traffic into the overlay network.</t>

<t>In order to prevent traffic injection to one virtual network, the
destination legitimate Geneve NVE MUST be able to authenticate the
incoming Geneve packets from the source NVE. Authenticated Geneve Packet
MAY be checked by underlay intermediary nodes.</t>

<t>This leads to the following security requirements:

<list style="format REQ%d:" counter="my_count">

<t>A Geneve NVE MUST be able to authenticate the Geneve tunnel Header,
and/or the Geneve base header, and/or the immutable Geneve Options,
and/or the Geneve payload.</t>

<t>A Geneve NVE MAY be able to authenticate only a portion of the Geneve
payload if the Tenant's system is protecting it's communication.</t>

<t>A transit underlay intermediary node MAY be able to validate the
authentication before the packet reaches the Geneve destination NVE.</t>

<t>A transit underlay intermediary node MUST be able to insert an
authenticated Geneve Option into a authenticated Geneve Packet -
protected by the source Geneve NVE.</t>

<t>A transit underlay intermediary node MUST be capable of forwarding
the Geneve authenticated packet as an non-authenticated Geneve
Packet.</t>

<t>A Geneve NVE SHOULD be able to set different security policies for
different flows. These flows MUST be identified from the Geneve Header
and/or Geneve Options as well as some inner traffic selectors.</t>  

<t>In the case when Tenant systems secure their communications using
protocols such as TLS or IPSec. A Geneve NVE MAY be able to selectively
encrypt and/or authenticate only the sections that are not
encrypted/authenticated by the Tenant System. For example, only the IP,
transport (TCP / UDP) in case of TLS/DTLS MAY be
encrypted/authenticated, while only the IP header and ESP header MAY be
encrypted/authenticated.</t>

</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Protecting against Traffic Redirection">

<t>A rogue device of the NVO3 overlay Geneve network or the underlay
network may leak and redirect the traffic from a virtual network to the
attacker for passive monitoring, or for actively re-injecting a modified
Geneve Packet into the overlay.</t>

<t>Re-injection through transit underlay nodes could be prevented by
authentication.</t>

<t>To prevent an attacker located in the middle between the NVEs and
modifying the tunnel address information in the data packet header to
redirect the data traffic, the solution need to provide confidentiality
protection for data traffics exchanged between NVEs.</t>

<t>This leads to the following security requirements:

<list style="format REQ%d:" counter="my_count">

<t>A Geneve NVE MUST be able encrypt Geneve base Header, and/or
Geneve Payload and/or Geneve Options not intended for the intermediary
Geneve nodes.</t>

<t>A Geneve NVE MAY be able encrypt portion of Geneve Payload as well as
as Geneve Options not intended for the intermediary Geneve nodes.</t>

<t>A transit underlay intermediary node MUST be able to insert an
encrypted Geneve Option into an encrypted/authenticated Geneve Packet -
protected by the source Geneve NVE.</t>

<t>A Geneve NVE SHOULD be able to assign different cryptographic
keys to protect the unicast tunnels between NVEs respectively.</t>

<t>If there are multicast packets, a Geneve NVE SHOULD be able to assign
distinct cryptographic group keys to protect the multicast packets
exchanged among the NVEs within different multicast groups. Upon
receiving a data packet, an egress Geneve NVE MUST be able to verify
whether the packet is sent from a proper ingress NVE which is authorized
to forward that packet.</t>

</list></t>

</section>

<section title="Protecting against Traffic replay">

<t>A rogue device of the NVO3 overlay Geneve network or the underlay
network may replay a Geneve packet, to load the network and/or a
specific Tenant System with a modified Geneve payload. In some cases,
such attacks may target an increase of the tenants costs.</t>

<t>When traffic between tenants is not protected, the rogue device may
forward the modified packet over a valid Geneve Header. The crafted
packet may for example, include a specifically crafted application
payload for a specific Tenant Systems application, with the intention to
load the tenant specific application.</t>

<t>Updating the Geneve header and option parameters such as setting an OAM
bit, adding bogus option TLVs, or setting a critical bit, may result in
different processing behavior, that could greatly impact performance of
the overlay network and the underlay infrastructure and thus affect the
tenants traffic delivery.</t>

<t>The NVO3 overlay network and underlay network nodes that may address
such attacks MUST provide means to authenticate the Geneve packet
components.</t> 

<t>This leads to the following security requirements:

<list style="format REQ%d:" counter="my_count">

<t>A Geneve NVE or a transit intermediary underlay node SHOULD be
able to validate the Geneve Header corresponds to the Geneve payload,
and discard such packets.</t>

<t>A Geneve NVE or a transit intermediary underlay node SHOULD
provide anti replay mechanisms and discarded replayed packet.</t>
